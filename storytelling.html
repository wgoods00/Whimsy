    "So, yo're in love with her?" Lila asked from a dark corner of the kitchen table. Mathew stopped on his way to
the coffeepot and turned toward her voice.<br>
 "Yeah," his graveled morning voice spoke deeply. He cleared his throat to go on. "How'd you know?"<br>
 "I thote at first I was imaginin' things, like that you had mo' spring in yo' step when you walked out the door, but
when I started findin' poems 'round the house, I figured it was another woman," she paused to light a Marlboro
cigarette with a match and blew the smoke from her mouth harshly. When she spoke again, it was with cold
bitterness. "Still, it coulda been an imaginary muse, or even me, so I didn' say a thing. But then you whispered her
name last night, Matt."<br>
 "I didn' think you'd heard me."<br>
 "'Course I heard you. But knowin' you been a'cheatin' on me? I just turned over and shut it out." Lila
took another drag from her cigarette while Mathew regained his composure. Her tone had
changed again when she spoke, now even slower and with more spite. "Now, tell me, Matty, what is it about this girl
that you're so very in love with? What's she got that I just can't seem to compete with?"<br>
 "Lila, don' do this," Mathew pleaded, turning away from his wife. He ran his large hands through his shaggy
brown hair and closed his eyes, counting to ten before turning back to her. "Just let me get my things and walk outta
here."<br>
 Lila dropped her blue eyes to the tiled floor and sighed. She took a drag off the cigarette and put it out in the
ceramic ashtray. Then she threw her attention on her husband again.<br>
 "Why d'you love her?" She asked calmly.<br>
 "You don' wanna know."<br>
 "If I didn', I wouldn' ask. You know me better than that, Matt," Lila tilted her head to the left and stared up at the
tall, lean man in front of her. She raised an eyebrow and opened her mouth to speak again but he cut her off.
 "I love her 'cause she reminds me o' you," he yelled in a rush.<br>
 "What nonsense are you talkin'?<br>
 "She reminds me o' the you that you use' to be. The you with hopes an' dreams an' questions an' answers, the you
with a heart o' gold an' open arms, a silver tongue an' soothin' words. The you who'd tell a person the brutal truth but
then fix 'em a drink to help wash it down. I miss the you I use' to love, Lila."<br>
 "And this girl reminds you o' me when you loved me? When you married me, I guess?"<br>
 "Yeah. She does."<br>
 "Then, Matt, y'all are gonna be real happy for a while. You know, 'til she grows up and realizes that though
you're gettin' older, you're not changin'. You'll hafta find another young girl to replace her just like you're replacin' me
now. I wish it wasn't like that, but that's the truth. Now, would you like a cup of Drano to choke all this down with?"<br>
 "I pity you, Lila. Really," Mathew said, turning toward the bedroom doorway. "You use' to be so beautiful, so
vibrant. Now, you're jus' bitter and diseased."<br>
 "An' how d'you think I got here, dear?" Lila yelled, finally losing her cool control. She rose from the table and
began to walk toward him. "I didn' go the many miles from young and vibrant and full o' life to ole an' dead inside by
myself, you know. No, you were there the whole way, beratin' me in that disgustin' candor you always had, with
twinklin' eyes, showin' me I could never be as good as you in any way. You beat me down into the thing I am now,
Mathew. Oh, but don't you worry, I won't put the blame on you. No, it's my fault. You see, I let you do it."<br>
 Lila's face was near his, whispering the last words, when he put his hands on her shoulders and began shaking
her. He shook her until Lila's eyes rolled into the back of her head and her small body crumpled in his arms and then
he let her go. She slumped down against the doorway, leaning against it and breathing heavily, as he spoke.<br>
 "I'll let you put the blame on me, I guess I did help turn you from a gorgeous, lovin' lady to a little girl in an old
woman's body."<br>
 "Oh, Matt, Oh, Matty," Lila moaned and held her head in her arms. "Oh, whatever happened to the boy I loved?
Somewhere along the way we both lost our loves. They must've died together. Now, ain't that a sweet thought?
Perhaps they went hand in hand floatin' down the river..."<br>
 "I'm leavin', Lila, I'm leavin' and I'm not comin' back," Mathew said sternly and sincerely. Lila looked up at him
with unfocused blue eyes and laughed.<br>
 "I know that, you idiot. I knew that all along, I've just been waitin' for it to happen is all."
